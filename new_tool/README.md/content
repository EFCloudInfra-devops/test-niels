# Juniper EX4300 Switch UI (NETCONF)

A minimal Docker Compose-based solution to visualize a Juniper EX4300-48P (Virtual Chassis), configure ports (VLAN access/trunk, PoE, speed/duplex), poll status, and audit/rollback via NETCONF.

**Scope (initial):** BRB2-ACCESS-SW01 (VC with 2 members), mgmt IP 10.22.0.11, JUNOS 21.4R3-S11.3.

## Quick Start
1. Place private key at `./secrets/id_rsa` and configure its public key on the switch.
2. Adjust `backend/.env` if needed.
3. Run:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d --build
   ```
   Frontend: http://localhost:8080 — Backend: http://localhost:8000/docs

## Features
- Port-grid per VC member (48x RJ-45 ge-*/0/*, 4x SFP+ xe-*/2/*)
- Modals: VLAN (access/trunk + native), PoE (RJ-45 only), speed/duplex
- Validation: VLAN 1–4094; PoE blocked on SFP+
- NETCONF candidate/commit (+ diff via compare rollback 0)
- Audit (SQLite) + rollback endpoint

## Known Constraints
- PoE is **never** allowed on SFP+ (xe-*/2/*).
- Junos NETCONF over SSH **port 830** recommended. (Sources: Juniper docs)
